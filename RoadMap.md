✅ Phase 0: Planning & Tech Stack Setup
MVP Definition: Resume builder, ATS analysis, skill-gap detection, resume version control, job recommendations, and AI-assisted suggestions.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Flutter with Riverpod or GetX.

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database (NoSQL) and Firebase Authentication.

AI/NLP: Integration with GPT APIs for AI suggestions.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for Flutter linting and testing.

🔐 Phase 1: Authentication & User Profiles
Firebase Authentication:

Email/password, Google, and Facebook sign-in methods.

Utilize firebase_auth and google_sign_in packages.

User Data Management:

Store user profiles in Firebase Realtime Database under /users/{uid}.

📝 Phase 2: Resume Data Entry Module
Multi-Step Form UI:

Sections: Personal Info, Education, Work Experience, Projects, Skills, Certifications, Summary, Hobbies & Interests.

Data Storage:

Save resumes under /resumes/{uid}/{resumeId} in Firebase Realtime Database.

Features:

Field validations, auto-suggestions, section-based saving, and draft functionality.

🧠 Phase 3: Resume Analysis & Skill Gap Detection
NLP Parsing & ATS Score Engine:

Analyze keyword frequency, format compliance, and skill matching.

The scoring logic is implemented in `lib/services/resume_scoring_service.dart`.

It calculates a total score (0-100) based on weighted scores of individual sections.

**Section Scoring:** Each section (Personal Info, Summary, Education, Experience, Skills, Projects, Certifications) is evaluated for completeness and content details based on predefined requirements (`_sectionRequirements`).

**ATS Compatibility:** A separate score is calculated based on the presence and relevance of industry-specific keywords found within the resume text, compared against predefined keyword lists (`_atsKeywords`).

**Total Score:** The overall score is a weighted average of all section scores, including ATS compatibility (`_sectionWeights`).

**Feedback:** Provides detailed suggestions and highlights strengths for each section and overall, based on the scores.

Backend Endpoint:

Implement Cloud Functions or integrate with external APIs for analysis.

Frontend Visuals:

Display ATS score progress bar, feedback icons, and suggested skills.

📄 Phase 4: Resume PDF Generation (Optional)
PDF Generation:

Use Flutter packages like pdf and printing to generate resumes in-app.

Provide templates and allow users to preview and download PDFs.

The PDF generation logic is in `lib/services/pdf_service.dart`.

💼 Phase 5: Job Recommendations
Job Matching Logic:

Use dummy job datasets or integrate with job APIs.

Match based on role, skills, location, and experience level.

UI Features:

Paginated job list with filters and match percentage indicators.

🆕 Phase 6: Resume Version Control
Data Structure:

Store versions under /resumes/{uid}/{resumeId}/versions/{versionId}.

Features:

Switch between versions, clone resumes, and edit version titles/tags.

🆕 Phase 7: Live Resume Score Assistant
Real-Time Analysis:

Analyze each form section live using debounce.

Evaluate word count, passive voice, and keyword presence.

Frontend Integration:

Show real-time ATS score per section with alert badges and suggestions.

🆕 Phase 8: In-App Resume Builder with AI Suggestions
GPT Integration:

Use OpenAI API or similar for AI-assisted content generation.

Inputs: job title, experience, skills.

Outputs: bullet points, summaries, improvements.

UI Features:

AI Suggest button for each section with preview and accept/modify options.

Limit API calls per user to manage usage.

🏅 Phase 9: Gamification & Badges
Achievements Logic:

Trigger badges for milestones like high ATS scores or using AI Assistant.

UI Features:

Badge gallery with animations and progress bars.

📊 Phase 10: Admin Panel & Analytics
Admin Features:

Manage resume templates, monitor user activity, and track resume stats.

Export data in CSV or Excel formats.

Security:

Implement role-based authentication for admin access.

✅ Phase 11: Testing, QA & Deployment
Testing:

Flutter widget and integration tests.

Security:

Firebase security rules and penetration testing.

Deployment:

Flutter Web: Firebase Hosting or Netlify.

Android/iOS: Deploy to Play Store & App Store.
